# Laboratorio di Fisica Computazionale

This repository contains the code i wrote and the data i used to solve a Data Challenge of my Computational Physics Laboratory. 
The aim of the challenge was to produce a report in which I had to show if there is (or not) any causal relationship between the GDP (in italian, PIL) of a country and its CO2 emissions.
